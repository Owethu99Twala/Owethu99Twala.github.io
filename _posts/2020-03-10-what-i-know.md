# What i have learnt from my time here so far

I have learnt alot at the Coding Ground, today I was learenning alot about CSS Grid, which is a responsive web design layout which lets you structure your website in a bit of a more complex yet neat/readable format. I have already acquired alot about the basics of CSS and HTML, although I want my knowledge to be expanded far greater than what I know right now. I'm confident i will be a coding machine once I'm done with my three years at The Coding Ground (TCG).
