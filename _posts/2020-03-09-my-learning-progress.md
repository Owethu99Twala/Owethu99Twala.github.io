# My learning progress 

Today I was busy learning about Applied Accessibility on the freecode camp platform. Which deals with making the website very user friendly to people that struggle with their disability or having impaired vision. I ended on the topic where I have to Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for Better Accessibility for users, basically making a list of things within a form that a user has to choose one attributre from.
