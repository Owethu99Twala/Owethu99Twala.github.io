# Code Pen Assignment

Today was good day, I got to make multiple of websites from Freecode Camp using CodePen. I've gotten assistance from the senior coders but it seems to become less and less where I am asking for their help since I'm challenging myself to know and get it right even if it takes me a while. I also like the struggle of trying to get the coding right, but if I exhaust all my options thats when i look for help from the senior coders.
