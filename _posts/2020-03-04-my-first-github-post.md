# My Time at freecode camp

My day was good, learnt alot from everyone and the senior programmers. We learnt about github and how to create folders in the terminal programme, which is confusing but I'm positive it will become my second nature. I also got to talk to Morale and he told me about his story and how he got to be where he is and I was given some positive pointers from him. We also had a presentation that also taught me certain things about html that I didnt know. So i would conclude and say that my day was very fruitful in terms of knowledge.
