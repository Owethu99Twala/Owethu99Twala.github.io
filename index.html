        <p> A young man who basically wants to break through barriers that have been formed against him.
            <br> I am someone who is dedicated to whatever I set my mind to just so I can prove people wrong.
            <br> I am a basic person who enjoys technology and how our world is evolving into the 4th industrial
            revolution, and its something i want to make sure that I am apart of.
            <br> I am currently enrolled at The Coding Ground ("TCG" for abbreviation) , which is a instituion where
            young like-minded people focus on writing code and bounce off ideas from each other.
            <br> I definately believe that I have a lot to offer to The Coding Ground and to any institution I am under.
