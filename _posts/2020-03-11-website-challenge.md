# website Challenge

My freecode camp progress has been a beneficial challenge, I've learnt alot from the day i signed up for freecode camp. The work I had to do today was based on making a website for a memoriable figure, and the topic I wanted to cover was Alfredo Bowman a.k.a "Dr Sebi", the man famously known to cure HIV/AIDS. I've been getting help from the senior coders, but it is not as much as it was before, which is very good on my side because it means that I am learning alot and I am on the road to being independent. Tomorow is another day and it makes me excited to come and learn more
